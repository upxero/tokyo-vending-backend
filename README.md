# Tokyo Vending Machine Backend

## Introduction
This document outlines the technical design for the backend of the Vending Machine application. The backend aims to provide a robust and efficient infrastructure to support the daily operations of the vending machine, along with tools for management and monitoring. Our goal is to enhance the overall user experience and provide administrators with comprehensive control over the machine's functionalities and performance.

## Problem Statement
In today's vending machine market, there's a growing demand for digital integration and advanced management tools. Customers expect seamless experiences, such as easy registration, login, and access to their order history. Administrators face the challenge of effectively monitoring the vending machines' operations. This goes beyond merely restocking products; they need access to relevant statistics and data analytics to make informed business decisions and adapt to consumer trends. Hence, an integrated and efficient management and monitoring system for vending machines is no longer a luxury but a necessity.

## Solution
To meet these identified needs, our application introduces a comprehensive solution to cater to the requirements of both users and administrators. Users are provided with an intuitive interface that enables them to effortlessly create accounts, log in, and access detailed order history, enhancing their interaction with the vending machine and delivering a personalized experience.

On the administrators' side, the application offers a robust administrative dashboard. This allows administrators to gain deep insights through order statistics, enabling them to make well-informed decisions. Furthermore, they have the ability to remotely control critical machine functions, such as opening or closing it, improving operational efficiency.
